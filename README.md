## Usage

        plugins {
           id 'org.xbib.gradle.plugin.jacc'
        }
        
        apply plugin: 'org.xbib.gradle.plugin.jacc'

Gradle will look for your jacc files in the source sets you specified.
By default, it looks with the pattern `**/*.jacc` under `src/main/jacc`
and `src/test/jacc`.

You can set up the source sets like this:

    sourceSets {
      main {
         jacc {
           srcDir "src/main/jacc"
         }
         java {
           srcDir "build/my-generated-sources/jacc"
         }
      }
    }
    
The lastJava `srcDir` definition will be used as the base for the Jacc target path.
If not given, the Jacc target path for generated Java source follows the pattern:

`${project.buildDir}/generated/sources/jacc`

The Jacc target path will be added automaticlly to the java compile task source directory 
of the source set.
