A Gradle plugin for [Jacc](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/jacc/)

## Usage

    apply plugin: 'java'
    apply plugin: 'jacc'

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
            maven {
                url "http://xbib.org/repository"
            }
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'org.xbib.gradle.plugins:gradle-plugin-jacc:1.0.0'
        }
    }
